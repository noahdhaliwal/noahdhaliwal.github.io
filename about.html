            <h3>Noah Dhaliwal<br>President</h3>
            <p>Noah Dhaliwal is a Woburn native and a current Boston College senior, a member of the class of 2024 within the Carroll School of Management. 
              He has been active in volunteer work all his life, helping out with political campaigns when he was young by holding signs, 
              serving food to participants at cancer walks, to being a staff member at several different ProCamps events. He currently works with the FYE office at Boston College with programs including Orientation and Compass Mentoring. The idea to create an event like Kick It, came from a long-lasting desire to give back to 
              his community and inspiration from the story of his co-founder Sam Gerry.
